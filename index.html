        <h3>The Role of a Doula</h3>
        <p>
          I believe death doulas have existed informally for all of time. As our
          Western culture has lost connection with the importance of holistic
          support, especially during intense periods of transition, more
          formalized roles have formed to fill these needs. I've heard it said
          that the generation that birthed midwifery and birth doulas are now
          reaching out for a different experience facing death. In our
          death-phobic, physical body-focused culture, death doulas are now
          emerging as a invaluable part of end of life care, providing the
          spiritual, emotional, mental and practical support that is fundamental
          to the transition of dying. This role nicely complements the important
          role of hospice and traditional end of life care. Due to constraints
          of insurance and the medical system, hospice services are restricted
          in what services can be preformed, how much time can be spent and ways
          of engagement. A death doula can fill these needs in a flexible,
          individualized way and provide a bridge between medical staff and
          family caregivers. Ideally, a death doula is a supportive, helpful
          presence that...

        <h3>About Sarah</h3>
        <p class="text">
          I'm a 32 year old "old soul" with a background in emergency medicine
          and neurology clinical research, and spent 7+ years intensively
          engaged in meditation and trauma healing work. I'm delighted to have
          been powerfully drawn to end of life care after profound experiences
          with death in my personal life and to watch these different parts of
          me integrate into this role that suits me so well. I've been honored
          to provide respite care, vigiling, active-dying support, end of life
          paperwork assistance, reiki, and dried flower arrangements. I'm
          regularly told I provide a gentle, grounding, comforting presence that
          feels like family. I seem to especially resonate with dementia
          patients and people who are extra sensitive to "outsiders". As I've
          learned to do for myself, I show up as a steadfast companion for
          whatever arises and have learned to never underestimate the power of
          good company.Â
